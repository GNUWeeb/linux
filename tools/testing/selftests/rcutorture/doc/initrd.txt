The rcutorture scripting tools automatically create the needed initrd
directory using either dracut or mkinitramfs.  This creation is done
by tools/testing/selftests/rcutorture/bin/mkinitrd.sh.

However, if you are attempting to run rcutorture on a system that does
not have either dracut or mkinitramfs installed, you might need to press
an existing initrd into service:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
cd tools/testing/selftests/rcutorture
zcat /initrd.img > /tmp/initrd.img.zcat # or from wherever inird lives
mkdir initrd
cd initrd
cpio -id < /tmp/initrd.img.zcat
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please note that not everything named "/initrd.img" is useful for actually
booting a Linux kernel.  If your choice doesn't work, please check the
resulting tools/testing/selftests/rcutorture/init directory to make sure
that it has "sh" and "sleep" commands along with the libraries needed
by these two commands.
