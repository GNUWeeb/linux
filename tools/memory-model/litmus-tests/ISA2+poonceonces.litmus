(*
 * Given a release-acquire chain ordering the first process's store
 * against the last process's load, is ordering preserved if all of the
 * smp_store_release() invocations be replaced by WRITE_ONCE() and all
 * of the smp_load_acquire() invocations be replaced by READ_ONCE()?
 * The answer is "no", that is, this test should be allowed.
