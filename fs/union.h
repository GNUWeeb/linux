/*
 * WARNING! Confusing terminology alert.
 *
 * Note that the directions "up" and "down" in union mounts are the
 * opposite of "up" and "down" in normal VFS operation terminology.
 * "up" in the rest of the VFS means "towards the root of the mount
 * tree."  If you mount B on top of A, following B "up" will get you
 * A.  In union mounts, "up" means "towards the most recently mounted
 * layer of the union stack."  If you union mount B on top of A,
 * following A "up" will get you to B.  Another way to put it is that
 * "up" in the VFS means going from this mount towards the direction
 * of its mnt->mnt_parent pointer, but "up" in union mounts means
 * going in the opposite direction (until you run out of union
 * layers).

/*
 * The union_stack structure.  It is an array of struct paths of
 * directories below the topmost directory in a unioned directory, The
 * topmost dentry has a pointer to this structure.  The topmost dentry
 * can only be part of one union, so we can reference it from the
 * dentry, but lower dentries can be part of multiple union stacks.
 *
 * The number of dirs actually allocated is kept in the superblock,
 * s_union_count.
