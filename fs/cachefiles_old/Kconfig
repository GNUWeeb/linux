config CACHEFILES_OLD
	tristate "Filesystem caching on files (old driver)"
	depends on FSCACHE_OLD && BLOCK && !FSCACHE
	help
	  This permits use of a mounted filesystem as a cache for other
	  filesystems - primarily networking filesystems - thus allowing fast
	  local disk to enhance the speed of slower devices.

	  [!] Note that this is mutually exclusive with the new cachefiles
	  driver.  Only one may be built as they share a lot of the same
	  symbols and also want to register the same device file.

	  See Documentation/filesystems/caching/cachefiles.rst for more
	  information.

config CACHEFILES_OLD_DEBUG
	bool "Debug CacheFiles"
	depends on CACHEFILES_OLD
	help
	  This permits debugging to be dynamically enabled in the filesystem
	  caching on files module.  If this is set, the debugging output may be
	  enabled by setting bits in /sys/modules/cachefiles/parameter/debug or
	  by including a debugging specifier in /etc/cachefilesd.conf.
