# FS QA Test No. 631
#
# Regression test to verify that creating a series of detached mounts,
# attaching them to the filesystem, and unmounting them does not trigger an
# integer overflow in ns->mounts causing the kernel to block any new mounts in
# count_mounts() and returning ENOSPC because it falsely assumes that the
# maximum number of mounts in the mount namespace has been reached, i.e. it
# thinks it can't fit the new mounts into the mount namespace anymore.
