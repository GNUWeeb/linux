/*
 * The following must be fixed before merging:
 *
 * - Add a timeout value to sys_acall_wait();
 *
 * - Add a signal specifier to struct acall_submission so that acall_thread
 * can send a signal as the operation completes.  The same goes for a 
 * signalfd.
 *
 * - Make sure that there is a limit to the number of threads which can be
 * created.  Hopefully RLIMIT_NPROC will be good enough.
 *
 * - Create per-arch helpers to call the syscalls.
 *
 * - Figure out what to do if acall_thread() can't write completion to
 * userspace.  Do we segfault?  Just ignore it?
 *
 * Here are some ideas for additional functionality:
 *
 * - Add a flag to specify that the operation should follow syslet semantics.
 * That is, that the new child returns to userspace when the submitting
 * context blocks.
 *
 * - Add a flag to specify that all the operations should be processed as 
 * concurrently as possible.
 *
 * - Coordinate with the scheduler so that sys_acall_submit() only proceeds
 * once acall_thread() blocks during processing.
 *
 * - Add a flag to put timestamps in acall_result.

 * We need to associate a userspace pointer with a wait queue so that

 *
 * We could do it with our own hashed wait queues.  We'd be recreating all the
 * problems that the hashed waitqueues in the zone already worry about --
 * contention, cache footprint, sizing to the system, etc.
 *
 * And further, it'd be perfectly legal for a task to be watching a result
 * structure which is mapped in shared memory at an address that is different
 * than the one that the completing task is writing to.  We'd work with this by
 * hashing by the low bits of the address.  Then we'd be limited to PAGE_SIZE /
 * sizeof(struct acall_result) = 256 hash buckets.
 *
 * Instead we resolve the result pointer down to the page struct that backs it
 * and hash that into the zone's wait queues.
 * We're trading scalability
 * for some page handling overhead in the completion path.  Ideally this will
 * almost always be cached and won't be a big deal. 
 *
 * The sleeper pins the page while it is asleep to make sure that the page
 * that backs the address doesn't change from under it while it sleeps.  IF
 * it did the waker would hash to a different wait queue and we'd miss
